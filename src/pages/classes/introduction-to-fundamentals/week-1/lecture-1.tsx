                You usually interact with a <LectureTip tip="Windows, icons, buttons, mouse — a layer on top of the OS to make things approachable. A convenience, not a necessity.">GUI</LectureTip>. Underneath it is a <LectureTip tip="A program that takes typed commands and passes them directly to the operating system. No middleman.">shell</LectureTip>. The <LectureTip tip="Also called command line, console, or CLI. The window where you type commands to the shell.">terminal</LectureTip> is where you talk to that shell.

                <strong className="text-foreground">nano</strong> is simpler: you type, then save and exit with the key combos shown at the bottom of the screen. <strong className="text-foreground">vim</strong> is powerful but modal — you switch between "normal" mode (commands) and "insert" mode (typing).
