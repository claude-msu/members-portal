You add a <LectureTerm>workflow</LectureTerm> file (YAML) to your repo that defines when to run (e.g. on push to main, on every PR) and what steps to execute (checkout code, install deps, run tests). Each run happens in a fresh virtual machine — you see pass/fail and logs directly on the PR.

The typical structure: (1) trigger on <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">push</code> and <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">pull_request</code> to main; (2) checkout the repo; (3) set up the runtime (Node, Python, etc.); (4) install dependencies; (5) run tests.

            <LectureP>
                Having CI is only half the story. Without <LectureTip tip="A GitHub repository setting that prevents direct pushes to a branch and requires conditions (passing CI, code review, etc.) before a PR can be merged. The strongest guard against broken main.">branch protection</LectureTip>, anyone can still merge a PR with failing tests — or push directly to main. Branch protection rules enforce that CI must pass before a PR can be merged.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="info">
                <strong>Enable branch protection:</strong> Go to your repo's Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule. Set the branch name pattern to <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">main</code>. Check "Require status checks to pass before merging" and select your workflow job name (e.g. <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">test</code> or <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">frontend</code> / <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">backend</code>). Optionally check "Require a pull request before merging" to prevent direct pushes.

            <LectureP>
                Once enabled, PRs show a "required" badge next to the CI check. The merge button stays disabled (grayed out) until all required checks are green. This is the single most effective guardrail for keeping main stable.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="tip">
                A green check on the PR means "tests passed." Get in the habit of not merging until the check is green. That single habit prevents most "it worked on my machine" breakages.

            <LectureP>
                Your first few CI runs will probably fail. That's normal — the point of CI is to catch problems early. Here's how to debug a failed workflow.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="warning">
                <strong>Common first-run failures:</strong> (1) wrong Node or Python version — match what you use locally; (2) missing environment variable — check if your app reads from <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">.env</code> which isn't committed; (3) test that passes locally but fails in CI because it depends on local data, a running server, or a different OS; (4) wrong <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">working-directory</code> — make sure the job runs from the right folder.
            </LectureCallout>

            <LectureP>
                Click the failed job in the Actions tab to see the full log. Each step has expandable output — find the red X and read the error. Most failures are one-line fixes: a missing dependency, a typo in the test command, or a version mismatch.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="tip">
                If a test passes locally but fails in CI, the difference is usually the environment. CI runs on a fresh Ubuntu VM with no state from previous runs. Check for hardcoded paths, missing env vars, or tests that depend on execution order.
