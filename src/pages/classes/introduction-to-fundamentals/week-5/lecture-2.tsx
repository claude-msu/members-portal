                In this course, each week after Sprint Planning is a <LectureTerm>sprint</LectureTerm>: a single theme (Containers, Backend, Testing, Frontend, Auth, Deployment). You are not doing "Sprint 1" then "Sprint 2" as separate review ceremonies — you set up <strong className="text-foreground">all</strong> sprint issues in advance. When you start Week 6, you pull the Containers issues; when you start Week 7, you pull the Backend issues; and so on. The board is your roadmap.

                Writing the full backlog now means you never have to "plan the next sprint" mid-course. You already know what each week ships. Execution is just: open the board, pick an issue for this week's theme, build it, open a PR, close the issue.

            <LectureP>
                The one-liner examples above are starting points — not finished issues. A real issue needs enough context that anyone on the team (including future-you, three weeks from now) can pick it up and know exactly what "done" looks like. Here is what a complete issue looks like in Markdown — the format GitHub uses for issue bodies.
            </LectureP>

            <CodeBlock

                    'As a user, I want to run the backend locally with one command',

            <LectureP>
                Notice the structure: a user story gives the <em className="text-foreground">why</em>, context gives the <em className="text-foreground">how</em> (enough to start, not a full spec), and acceptance criteria are checkboxes — GitHub renders them as a clickable checklist inside the issue. When all boxes are checked, the issue is done.

                GitHub Markdown checkboxes (<code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">- [ ]</code>) are interactive — you can check them off directly in the issue without editing the body. The issue list even shows a progress bar like "2/4 tasks complete."

                Every issue should have <LectureTip tip="Concrete, testable conditions that must be true for an issue to be considered done. Written as checkboxes in the issue body.

The difference between a useful issue and a useless one almost always comes down to whether the criteria are testable.

                The testable versions can be verified by running a command or opening a URL — there is no ambiguity about whether they pass. Write 2–4 criteria per issue so you (and anyone reviewing your PR) know when to close it.

When the PR merges, GitHub will close the issue and move the card on your board automatically. Your board stays in sync with reality.

                Add a point estimate to each issue you create — either in the issue title (e.g. "[3pt] Dockerfile for backend") or as a custom field in GitHub Projects. After a few weeks you'll see whether you're consistently finishing 8 points per week or 15, and you can plan accordingly.

                Once this file is committed, anyone clicking "New Issue" on your repo will see a "Feature" template option. The body is pre-filled with the headings and placeholders — they just fill in the blanks. You can create additional templates for bug reports, chores, or any other issue type your project needs.

            <LectureCallout type="tip">
                Setting up an issue template is optional for this course but highly recommended. It takes five minutes and saves time on every issue you create for the rest of the project. It also demonstrates repo hygiene that employers look for in portfolio projects.
