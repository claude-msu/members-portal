                    You already have a repo and GitHub Project board from Week 4 (Project Kickoff). This activity is about populating the board with issues for <strong className="text-foreground">every</strong> remaining week — so when you start Week 6, you're just pulling the Containers issues; when you start Week 7, the Backend issues; and so on. No mid-course sprint planning needed.

                    Every issue you create should be clear enough that someone with no context can pick it up and know exactly what to build and when it's done. Use the structure from Lecture 2: user story, context, and testable acceptance criteria as checkboxes.
