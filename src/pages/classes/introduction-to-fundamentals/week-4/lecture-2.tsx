            <LectureP>
                You now know how to branch, commit, and merge locally. In practice, teams don't merge by running <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">git merge</code> on each other's branches. They use <LectureTermWithTip tip="A proposal to merge your branch into another (usually main). Includes a description, discussion thread, and optional required approvals before merge.">pull requests</LectureTermWithTip> (PRs): you push your branch to GitHub, open a PR to propose merging it into <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">main</code>, someone reviews your code, and then the merge happens. The PR is the unit of review and the audit trail for every change.
            </LectureP>
            <LectureP>
                Pull requests connect Git (the mechanics) to how work actually gets done: an issue describes what to build, a branch holds the code, and the PR ties them together so that when the PR merges, the issue closes and the board updates. That loop — idea → issue → branch → PR → merge → done — is the Agile workflow in practice.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="info">
                "Pull request" and "merge request" (GitLab) mean the same thing: a request to merge your branch into the target branch, with a discussion thread and optional required approvals. GitHub calls them PRs; GitLab calls them MRs.

            <PRWorkflow />

            <LectureP>
                After you push your branch, go to your repo on GitHub. You'll often see a yellow banner: "feature/add-login had recent pushes" with a button <strong className="text-foreground">Compare & pull request</strong>. Click it. Add a title and a description: what does this PR do? Why? How can a reviewer test it? Link the issue it addresses with "Closes #42" so GitHub auto-closes the issue when the PR merges.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureSubHeading title="What to put in a PR description" />
            <LectureP>
                Good PR descriptions save reviewers time and leave a record for the future. Include: a short summary of the change, what problem it solves, how to test it (steps or a checklist), and any screenshots or notes for reviewers. In industry, PR templates (stored in <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md</code>) standardize this so every PR has the same structure.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="tip">
                Write "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123" in the PR description. When the PR is merged, GitHub automatically closes that issue and moves it to Done on your project board. No manual dragging required — the board stays in sync with the code.
            </LectureCallout>

            <LectureSubHeading title="Review and merge" />
            <LectureP>
                Reviewers comment on specific lines or the whole PR. They can approve, request changes, or suggest edits. Once the branch is approved (and any required checks pass, e.g. CI), someone merges the PR. GitHub offers merge options: create a merge commit, squash all commits into one, or rebase. Teams usually choose one and stick to it so history is consistent.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="warning">
                Don't merge your own PR without review unless your team explicitly allows it. The whole point is a second set of eyes — catching bugs, suggesting cleaner approaches, and sharing context. Skipping review is a common source of regressions and technical debt.
            </LectureCallout>

            {/* ── 03 ISSUES AS THE SOURCE OF WORK ──────────────────────────────── */}

            <LectureP>
                Every piece of work should start as an <LectureTermWithTip tip="A single unit of work in GitHub: bug report, feature request, or task. Has a title, description, labels, and can be linked to PRs.">issue</LectureTermWithTip>: a bug report, a feature request, or a task. Issues live in the <LectureTermWithTip tip="The ordered list of work that might get done. Items sit here until the team pulls them into the current sprint or cycle.">backlog</LectureTermWithTip> until the team decides to do them. When you're ready to work on something, you assign yourself (or get it assigned), create a branch, and when you open a PR you link it to the issue. That way the issue tracks the work from "to do" to "in progress" to "done."
            </LectureP>
            <LectureP>
                Issues don't have to be huge. "Add a README section for setup" is a valid issue. "Fix typo in login error message" is too. The goal is traceability: every change is tied to a reason, and every reason is visible in the backlog and on the board.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="tip">
                Use issue templates (e.g. <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md</code>) so reporters fill in the right fields: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment. It keeps issues actionable instead of vague.

                <LectureTermWithTip tip="A mindset and set of practices: deliver working software in small increments, get feedback early, and adapt. Emphasizes people and flexibility over rigid plans.">Agile</LectureTermWithTip> means shipping small increments, getting feedback, and adapting. Instead of planning a whole product upfront and building it in one shot (waterfall), teams work in short cycles: pick a chunk of work from the backlog, build it, ship it, learn from it, then repeat. The backlog is the ordered list of everything that might get built; the current cycle (sprint or just "in progress") is what the team is doing now.
            </LectureP>
            <LectureP>
                Two common ways to run this: <LectureTermWithTip tip="A framework with fixed-length iterations (sprints), planning at the start, and a retrospective at the end. Roles include Scrum Master and Product Owner.">Scrum</LectureTermWithTip> (fixed-length sprints, e.g. 2 weeks, with planning and retro at the boundaries) and <LectureTermWithTip tip="A flow-based method. Work moves across columns (e.g. To Do → In Progress → Done). No fixed sprint length; optional WIP limits per column.">Kanban</LectureTermWithTip> (continuous flow with a board and optional WIP limits). Many teams mix both: a board with columns like Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done, and optional time-boxed sprints for planning and demos.
            </LectureP>

            <KanbanBoard />

            <LectureCallout type="info">
                The backlog is never "finished" — it's a living list. New ideas and bugs get added; priorities change. The sprint (or current work) is a commitment: we will finish these items by the end of the cycle. That tension — infinite backlog, finite sprint — is what keeps agile focused.
            </LectureCallout>

            {/* ── 05 GITHUB PROJECTS ─────────────────────────────────────────── */}

                <LectureTermWithTip tip="GitHub's built-in project management: boards or tables linked to your repo. Issues become cards; PRs that close issues update the board automatically.">GitHub Projects</LectureTermWithTip> gives you a board (Kanban or table view) tied directly to your repo. Create a project from the repo's Projects tab, add columns like Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done, and add your issues as cards. When you open a PR that "Closes #5," the issue card can move to Done automatically. No separate Jira or Trello — the board lives next to the code.

            <LectureP>
                For this course, you'll create a GitHub Project for your capstone repo, add issues for the work you plan across the remaining weeks, and ship every deliverable via a PR that closes an issue. By the end you'll have a real workflow: idea → issue → branch → PR → review → merge → done.

            <LectureP>
                Code review is not about finding fault — it's about catching bugs early, sharing context across the team, and collectively improving code quality. Every PR you open will be reviewed, and you'll review others'. Doing this well is a career-long skill.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureSubHeading title="As a reviewer" />
            <LectureP>
                Read the PR description first so you understand the intent. Then look at the diff: does the code do what the description says? Are there edge cases? Is anything confusing? Leave comments on specific lines — GitHub lets you click a line number in the diff to start a comment thread. Be constructive: explain <em>why</em> something should change, not just <em>that</em> it should.
            </LectureP>
            <LectureP>
                GitHub offers a <LectureTermWithTip tip="Click the ± icon on a line in a PR diff and write a code suggestion in a fenced code block. The author can accept with one click and it creates a commit automatically. Faster than describing the change in words.">Suggest changes</LectureTermWithTip> feature: click the <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded border">±</code> icon on a line, write your proposed code, and the author can accept it with one click.

            </LectureP>
            <LectureP>
                When you're done, submit your review with one of three statuses: <LectureTerm>Approve</LectureTerm> (looks good, merge it), <LectureTerm>Request changes</LectureTerm> (needs work before merging), or <LectureTerm>Comment</LectureTerm> (feedback without a blocking verdict).
            </LectureP>

            <LectureSubHeading title="As an author" />
            <LectureP>
                Keep PRs small and focused — one logical change per PR. A 50-line PR gets careful review; a 500-line PR gets a rubber stamp. Respond to every comment: either make the change or explain why you disagree. Don't take feedback personally — your reviewer is reviewing the code, not you.
            </LectureP>

            <LectureCallout type="tip">
                The best PRs are boring to review. If your reviewer has to spend 20 minutes understanding the change, the PR is too big or the description is too sparse. Make it easy for them and you'll get faster, better reviews.
